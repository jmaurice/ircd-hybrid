 Known Bugs worthy of a mention:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
1.  /MODUNLOAD causes cores:
    - If a module is modified before being unloaded, /MODUNLOAD (and
      therefore /MODRELOAD) may cause a core.

      This problem is caused by the behaviour of the OS, which treats
      shared libraries differently to executables (modifying the ircd
      binary whilst it is running would also cause a core, but is denied
      by the OS). There is no way to fix this at the application level,
      and fixing the OS to do the right thing is also difficult.

      A workaround to avoid coring is possible however. To install new
      modules, first remove or rename the old module, then copy/move the
      new file into place. /MODUNLOAD will then work successfully.

      Alternatively, running ./configure with the --disable-shared-modules
      argument will link all the commands statically, losing the advantages
      of upgrading at runtime, but reducing the chances of accidentally
      coring your server.

2.  Solaris stock 32bit stdio is limited to 256 fds. This breaks when using
    cryptlinks.

3.  New bug reported in some 64 bit and powerpc (yellowdog linux) code.
    This bug is actually in gcc itself, the spec says you don't modify
    a va_list in libc, but gcc does. The bug manifests itself as
    immediately coring when anyone types anything on a channel.
    You will find a quick work around in contrib until this bug in gcc
    is fixed.

    This is a quick test program
    libc_vprintf
    cc -o libc_vprintf libc_vprintf.c
    ./libc_vprintf

    If the program doesn't core, you are fine.

    The work around is the vprintf_fix.patch in contrib.
