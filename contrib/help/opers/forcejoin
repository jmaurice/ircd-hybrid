FORCEJOIN <nickname> <channel>

The FORCEJOIN command requires two arguments to be given. The first
argument is the nickname of the user you wish to execute the command
on, and the second argument is the destination channel they are to join.

The command can also be used to force join a user to a channel that does
not exist.
